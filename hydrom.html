    <h1>How we Made it:Hydroelectric Generator</h1>
<a href="hydro.html"><img src="back.png" width=70px height=70px></a>
    <p>This unique model is made
        from various materials. At the bottom is a container
        filled with water. To the left of the
        container is a  stand holding a
        can/bottle, which is filled with water.<br><br> A
        straw leads out of the bottle, which would
        drain the water from the can/bottle.The can/bottle acts as a reservoir. To the
        bottom right of the straw is a water wheel,
        which when the water is drained through
        the straw, would spin.<br><br> A hobby dynamo
         is paired with the water wheel. It
        will
        convert mechanic energy, produced by the
        spinning water wheel, into electrical
        energy.</p>
